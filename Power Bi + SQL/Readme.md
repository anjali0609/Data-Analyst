# 🏥 Hospital Insights Overview Dashboard

Welcome to the *Hospital Insights* project! This interactive dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of hospital operations, providing actionable insights based on real-world healthcare data.

##  Project Overview

This project showcases my ability to:
- Extract and transform data using *SQL*
- Create interactive dashboards using *Power BI*
- Deliver insights for data-driven decision-making in the *healthcare domain*

It was my *first successful integration of SQL and Power BI*, developed as a standalone case study to explore doctor performance, revenue, patient behavior, and operational trends.
