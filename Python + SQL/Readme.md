# E-commerce Data Analysis with Python and SQL

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce dataset. It leverages SQL queries executed within a Python environment to extract valuable insights into sales patterns, customer demographics, and product performance. Data manipulation and visualization are handled using popular Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### Key Analyses and Findings ðŸ“Š

* *Customer and Order Metrics*:
    *A list of all unique cities where customers are located was generated.
    * The total number of orders placed in 2017 was found to be 90,202
    * The number of customers from each state was counted, with SÃ£o Paulo (SP) having the highest count.
    * It was determined that approximately 99.9981% of all orders were paid in installments.

* *Sales Performance*:
    * Total sales were calculated for each product category, with the "bed table bath" category showing the highest sales figures.
    *The percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category was analyzed
    * The number of orders per month in 2018 was tracked, with January having the highest volume and a notable decline in the later months.
    * Cumulative sales per month were calculated for each year to track growth over time
    * The year-over-year sales growth rate was calculated, revealing a significant increase of 12112.70% from 2016 to 2017, and a 20.00% increase from 2017 to 2018

* *Product and Customer Insights*:
    * The analysis found a low correlation of 0.106 between the price of a product and the number of times it was purchased.
