# Project Summary
This project focuses on Customer Churn Analysis using Python. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and factors that influence customer churn.

I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. This project helped me understand how to extract insights from raw data and visualize trends that can help businesses make informed decisions.

## Dataset 
 `Dataset`-<a href="https://github.com/anjali0609/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/customer%20Analysis/Customer%20Churn.csv">Link</a> 

## Key Objectives:
 -Understand the structure of the dataset

 -Analyze customer behavior and churn trends

 -Visualize relationships between features like contract type, tenure, and monthly charges

Identify key factors contributing to churn

##  Tools & Libraries:
 -Python

**Pandas** – for data manipulation and preprocessing

**Matplotlib** – for basic plotting

 **Seaborn**– for advanced visualizations

## Key Insights:
 -Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn

 -Higher monthly charges are associated with higher churn

 -Longer-tenure customers tend to stay longer

 -Services like Online Security and Tech Support are linked to lower churn rates
